Marking 'alpha-blockers' with +

MISC/TRIAGE
===
- autosave toggle
- in the interest of including lots of classes, maybe you should 'copy-paste' some perks/req'ts (and make it easy to do so with the class hierarchy). For example, something similar (/identical) to 'Frugivore', but for a different skill? You're already kind of doing this with e.g. horseman and gladiator.
- I think the buff constructor stuff was actually unnecessary? should probably walk it back? Bleh
+- figure out hosting/exoprting
+?- review code TODOs
- show ancestry buff calculations in stats page
- classes/farmer style routes
    - (and have some default - either the current class, or whatever was viewed last)
+- add a 'retreat' button next to 'Stop' that ends the current action (giving no benefits) and starts a new one. I don't think it's a bad behavior to enable.
- Restore character name thing? Maybe just prompt for a name at the very beginning and use that throughout?
- add ability to specify post-action text in ActionData

BALANCE
=======
- extra perks (other classes) as fn of max lvl with current class (or even just current lvl). Maybe one extra perk at level 100, then 200, etc.
- bonus gains for zones that train multiple skills (right now I think this happens for individual *actions* that train multiple skills, but not across zones)
+?- it's annoying that if my skill level in X is such that all X actions are red, there's not really anything I can do about it, other than grin and bear it. Maybe this is a good argument for cross-skill bootstrapping for multi-skill actions (i.e. really good combat skill should offset some of my bad stealth skill in a combat/stealth zone).
    *** yeah, I think this is important. I think it'd be good if you could offset slowdown penalty by overcompensating with a different skill, or just by raising your plvl sufficiently. Could make path through zones more strategic and less linear. Would also maybe help make leveling up feel more immediately impactful.
    - maybe compare mastery level to focal skill lvl + some fraction of plvl (or, equiv. total slvls). This would probably require some significant reworking of XP formulas.
- Seems like ancestry bonus is basically just a linear multiplier on your progress speed throughout your lifetime. It follows that...
    - if we want high level zones to only be tractable with a high ancestry bonus (and/or more advanced classes), then lower level zones will be blazingly fast when those conditions are met. Is this a problem? Maybe not.
    - what if ancestry bonus was an aptitude multiplier *per player level*?
- maybe, like, double base action speed and SP gains across the board? seems like a fair bit of time is spent in green zones, and those actions feel like they blaze by, faster than my hilarious action text can be read.
    - Another option: make the slowdown curve kind of S-shaped.
- the Bat King is great. You should do more stuff like that in lower level zones.
- balancing zone difficulty: kind of want to hit a sweet spot where some zones are too hard when first unlocked, but most zones are sort of boringly easy around the time you're about to unlock the next batch.
+- Consider adding some kind of table in the debug view showing SP/level, SP/action, and their ratio for different values of level (and adjusted by various levels of HA buff). Should be fairly easy to make, and would really help balancing.
- would be interesting to review expected SP gains for each zone. I suspect that zones with bonus actions may have a big advantage (and that high bonus levels might exert a disproportionate influence, despite their low frequency)
- consider rescaling to 10 skill levels per plvl? Removes some incentive to micro-manage skill bars, and skill ups become twice as frequent. Meaning if you're adventuring in a slowdown zone, you get to see more frequent small decreases in the slowdown %.
- add 1 or 2 more superzones with level reqs way out there (and consider pushing back hinterlands too). With the intention that you'll only really be able to reach them by going over leveled-up versions of previous zones.

TECHNICAL
=========
- figure out how to write better/more parsimonious CSS. Does angular offer less-like stuff?
- switch to attributive components?
+?- profile the thing
- should think about trying to reconcile passives and buffs (so that it's easy to make one out of the other)
- complete migration to RC5
    - http://angularjs.blogspot.ca/2016/08/angular-2-rc5-ngmodules-lazy-loading.html
    - https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html
- ahead of time compilation
    - also keep seeing this thing about enableProdMode(). Should look into that.
- consider propagating 'bonus'-ness up. Might be interesting to show it in the UI, and to have it interact with some perks.
- ability to export to/load from string. Would make testing a lot easier.
- redo systemjs.config.js to match the new version in the angular2 quickstart
- from profiling, it seems like jquery is getting called somewhere? how'd that happened? Dependency of the notifications/modals library?
- it would really help testing if there was a quick way to change some of the stuff in GLOBALS (cheatMode and autoSave, primarily), without a recompile/refresh. Maybe in the debug view (problematic since its visibility is now conditioned on cheatMode), or in the console.

MECHANICS
=========
+?- zone leveling
    - one important aspect of this is to make sure the difficulty jumps between levels are quite high. This should help discourage the behavior of just focusing on one or two zones and leveling them to the exclusion of all others.
    - maybe leveling up a zone should unlock the 'oneshot' actions in that zone?
- item drops
- bonus zones

BUGS
====
- minor bug: zone level pane expanding shouldn't be as sticky as it is
+- have seen at least one instance where an action got 'stuck' (but was able to finish it by clicking). That's a little scary. I have a fear that my code is crawling with race conditions.
- title text not showing up when hovering on buffed skill level
- saw an instance of a skill going to -10 after reincarnation because of a fruity cleanup phase
- based on the wording of the unlock hint, it feels like a bug that Scholar isn't unlocked immediately when you hit level 20 as a student (rather than when you reincarnate)
- Can scum by refreshing to reset cooldowns. Bleh. Anyone who does this gets the punishment of tedium that they deserve.
    - also, since there's no explicit save button, and autosave is only every 30s, this doesn't work out all that well
- can you meditate more than once during a really long action and pump up the multiplier? I should check. Though if someone does that, I'd kind of be tempted to just congratulate them on their cleverness.
    - yeah, looks like this is definitely possible. only scales additively though, and given gated access to high level zones, I'm inclined to leave this in as a sort of easter egg.
- 'a encyclopedia'

IDEAS
======
- more immediate benefits/sense of progression associated with leveling up?
- actual prestiging
- associate a color with each skill?
- class homages to other games (hack, FFT, disgaea)
- 'second-tier' classes (with branching options, like Wesnoth, Fire Emblem, etc.)
- add some 'dud' actions - ones with very low difficulty/SP-gains compared to others in the zone
- ability to specify actions that only appear at some minimum zone level.
- could borrow some thematic flavour from the actual ToH concept (a "staffing agency" for heroes)
    - what if characters were randomly assigned really mundane white names? e.g. "Karen the level 5 Shaman", "Donald the level 10 Skeleton".
- might actually be interesting to exercise the ability to change action duration on a per-zone basis. Though this could be confusing (construed as slowdown). Maybe if there are any 'final boss' zones, they should have this - and it should be exaggerated.

UI
==
- make checkbox in classes component bootstrappy
- the colors for skill difficulty (in zone summary) and apts (class view) are fugly. We can do better.
    - maybe the green skill icons should just be the default color
- forward/back arrows in the classes view 'porthole'
    - ooh, and keyboard navigation
- would also be nice to have keyboard shortcuts for spells
+?- distinguish in the UI between a permanently buffed stat and a temp buffed one (light green vs. dark green?)
+?- there's a weird bug where like 5% of the time the progress bar doesn't reset to 0, but uses a long transition
- add a nice CSS transition to progress bar when clicked
- zone difficulty UI should probably incorporate cleric perk
    - buffedstatcomponent
- klass component: make icons in grid clickable
    - done, but they should also have clickable cursors
- color action bars by inexp. penalty?
- icons for perks?
- ticker. Where to put it, what to say in it. Current thinking: modal alerts for significant one-time-ish events? And a small scrolling action log in the focal zone view for more spammy stuff?
- unit animations
- three label colors for buffs. One for HA, one for all other passives, and one for temporary buffs.
- A good argument for refactoring the current "last outcome" display into some kind of scrolling ticker: I like the idea of a spell that just gives you some random SP. But it seems important to show the player somewhere how many SP they got in which skills. Where would that be currently? Doesn't make sense to tie to action completion. I'm sure there are going to be other cases like this.
- +1 animation for player level. Better yet: a different animation from skill level. What if the old level just sort of fell to the side and down? That could be kinda funny.
- Across the board, need to work on number formatting. May end up with some super-duper-big numbers eventually - should have a way of dealing with that using scientific notation or whatever. Also, should probably do that classic incremental game thing of giving the option of abbreviations, scientific notation, or whatever else.
- Look into restyling the skill view in the player component.
    - takes up too much vertical space
    - numbers aren't vertically aligned
    - aptitude numbers not nicely aligned, and won't transition gracefully to large values.
    - consider scrunching like the apt view in class component?
- could be nice to replace use of title text (e.g. for showing elaborations on zone difficulty) with something more 'modern' (and mobile friendly?)
- zi token toasts should have a timeout (and maybe classes too)

USABILITY
=========
- might actually be a good idea to make locked superzones expandable, just without the "go" buttons. Would help with planning ahead. Maybe only after it's been unlocked once in a previous lifetime?
- maybe a 'tips' section?
- for 'on/off' perks, consider indicating in the UI whether they're currently active?
    - and/or: can perks be made more visible in the lastOutcome UI? use buffedstat component for SP gains that are increased by perks? right now perks maybe don't *feel* as impactful as they should.
- the 'go' buttons in the zone summary view are kinda dumb. Maybe the zone name should just be a link.
- give toasts on superzone unlock? (at least the first time)
- ability to sort the skill pane by level/apt/progress would be quite nice. Would help determine which skills are underleveled, for example.
    - not clear whether it should be a one-time reordering, or if skills should continually shift to maintain the sort as they get trained/buffed. The latter could be confusing, and sounds harder to implement, and more risky from a perf pov.
- indicate in the UI which zone you are in ('You are here') and which zone you're adventuring in. It's easy to forget the latter.
    - maybe even show a miniature action bar in the summary pane if you're not currently there? that'd be siiiiiiick
