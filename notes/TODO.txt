Marking 'alpha-blockers' with +

MISC/TRIAGE
===
- autosave toggle
- in the interest of including lots of classes, maybe you should 'copy-paste' some perks/req'ts (and make it easy to do so with the class hierarchy). For example, something similar (/identical) to 'Frugivore', but for a different skill? You're already kind of doing this with e.g. horseman and gladiator.
- I think the buff constructor stuff was actually unnecessary? should probably walk it back? Bleh
+- figure out hosting/exoprting
+?- review code TODOs
- show ancestry buff calculations in stats page
- classes/farmer style routes
    - (and have some default - either the current class, or whatever was viewed last)
+- add a 'retreat' button next to 'Stop' that ends the current action (giving no benefits) and starts a new one. I don't think it's a bad behavior to enable.
- Restore character name thing? Maybe just prompt for a name at the very beginning and use that throughout?
- add ability to specify post-action text in ActionData

BALANCE
=======
- extra perks (other classes) as fn of max lvl with current class (or even just current lvl). Maybe one extra perk at level 100, then 200, etc.
- bonus gains for zones that train multiple skills (right now I think this happens for individual *actions* that train multiple skills, but not across zones)
+?- it's annoying that if my skill level in X is such that all X actions are red, there's not really anything I can do about it, other than grin and bear it. Maybe this is a good argument for cross-skill bootstrapping for multi-skill actions (i.e. really good combat skill should offset some of my bad stealth skill in a combat/stealth zone).
- Seems like ancestry bonus is basically just a linear multiplier on your progress speed throughout your lifetime. It follows that...
    - if we want high level zones to only be tractable with a high ancestry bonus (and/or more advanced classes), then lower level zones will be blazingly fast when those conditions are met. Is this a problem? Maybe not.
    - what if ancestry bonus was an aptitude multiplier *per player level*?
- maybe, like, double base action speed and SP gains across the board? seems like a fair bit of time is spent in green zones, and those actions feel like they blaze by, faster than my hilarious action text can be read.
    - Another option: make the slowdown curve kind of S-shaped.
- the Bat King is great. You should do more stuff like that in lower level zones.
- balancing zone difficulty: kind of want to hit a sweet spot where some zones are too hard when first unlocked, but most zones are sort of boringly easy around the time you're about to unlock the next batch.
+- Consider adding some kind of table in the debug view showing SP/level, SP/action, and their ratio for different values of level (and adjusted by various levels of HA buff). Should be fairly easy to make, and would really help balancing.

TECHNICAL
=========
- make sure it runs in the background
- figure out how to write better/more parsimonious CSS. Does angular offer less-like stuff?
- switch to attributive components?
+?- profile the thing
- should think about trying to reconcile passives and buffs (so that it's easy to make one out of the other)
- complete migration to RC5
    - http://angularjs.blogspot.ca/2016/08/angular-2-rc5-ngmodules-lazy-loading.html
    - https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html
- ahead of time compilation
- consider propagating 'bonus'-ness up. Might be interesting to show it in the UI, and to have it interact with some perks.
- ability to export to/load from string. Would make testing a lot easier.
- redo systemjs.config.js to match the new version in the angular2 quickstart

MECHANICS
=========
+?- zone leveling
    - one important aspect of this is to make sure the difficulty jumps between levels are quite high. This should help discourage the behavior of just focusing on one or two zones and leveling them to the exclusion of all others.
    - maybe leveling up a zone should unlock the 'oneshot' actions in that zone?
- item drops
- bonus zones

BUGS
====
+- have seen at least one instance where an action got 'stuck' (but was able to finish it by clicking). That's a little scary. I have a fear that my code is crawling with race conditions.
- skill icons should be green if slowdown rounds down to 0%.

IDEAS
======
- more immediate benefits/sense of progression associated with leveling up?
- actual prestiging
- associate a color with each skill?
- class homages to other games (hack, FFT, disgaea)
- 'second-tier' classes (with branching options, like Wesnoth, Fire Emblem, etc.)
- add some 'dud' actions - ones with very low difficulty/SP-gains compared to others in the zone

UI
==
- the colors for skill difficulty (in zone summary) and apts (class view) are fugly. We can do better.
- forward/back arrows in the classes view 'porthole'
    - ooh, and keyboard navigation
- would also be nice to have keyboard shortcuts for spells
+?- distinguish in the UI between a permanently buffed stat and a temp buffed one (light green vs. dark green?)
+?- there's a weird bug where like 5% of the time the progress bar doesn't reset to 0, but uses a long transition
- add a nice CSS transition to progress bar when clicked
- zone difficulty UI should probably incorporate cleric perk
- klass component: make icons in grid clickable
    - done, but they should also have clickable cursors
- color action bars by inexp. penalty?
- icons for perks?
- ticker. Where to put it, what to say in it. Current thinking: modal alerts for significant one-time-ish events? And a small scrolling action log in the focal zone view for more spammy stuff?
- unit animations
- three label colors for buffs. One for HA, one for all other passives, and one for temporary buffs.
- A good argument for refactoring the current "last outcome" display into some kind of scrolling ticker: I like the idea of a spell that just gives you some random SP. But it seems important to show the player somewhere how many SP they got in which skills. Where would that be currently? Doesn't make sense to tie to action completion. I'm sure there are going to be other cases like this.
- +1 animation for player level. Better yet: a different animation from skill level. What if the old level just sort of fell to the side and down? That could be kinda funny.
- Across the board, need to work on number formatting. May end up with some super-duper-big numbers eventually - should have a way of dealing with that using scientific notation or whatever. Also, should probably do that classic incremental game thing of giving the option of abbreviations, scientific notation, or whatever else.
- Look into restyling the skill view in the player component.
    - takes up too much vertical space
    - numbers aren't vertically aligned
    - aptitude numbers not nicely aligned, and won't transition gracefully to large values.
    - consider scrunching like the apt view in class component?

USABILITY
=========
- might actually be a good idea to make locked superzones expandable, just without the "go" buttons. Would help with planning ahead. Maybe only after it's been unlocked once in a previous lifetime?
